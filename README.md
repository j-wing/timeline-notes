# TimeLine Notes

A simple note-taking app that associates last-edit timestamps with each line of your note. This is useful for keeping track of the flow of a meeting, interview, etc.

TimeLine also supports auto-syncing notes to Google Drive: sign into Drive via the menu and a doc will get created and synced every time you open the app. You can find them in a "Synced TimeLine Notes" directory in your Drive.
